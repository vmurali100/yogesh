      Bengaluru (also called Bangalore) is the capital of India's southern
      Karnataka state. The center of India's high-tech industry, the city is
      also known for its parks and nightlife. By Cubbon Park, Vidhana Soudha is
      a Neo-Dravidian legislative building. Former royal residences include
      19th-century Bangalore Palace, modeled after England’s Windsor Castle, and
      Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace, an 18th-century teak structure.
